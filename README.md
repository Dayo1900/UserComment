# UserComment

This page is about session management with PHP.

Whenever users post comments, it will be displayed with timestamps. 

Nothing is stored in a database because it's only for test purposes.
To make things short, a user can make a maximum of two posts which will be stored in session variables. 
Comments from users are printed from there.

In the next page user posts are displayed by calling the session variables.

Some of the PHP functions used are: date_default_timezone_set(), $_SESSION[], and date().</p>
